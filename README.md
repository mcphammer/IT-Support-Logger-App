# IT Support Logger App

The IT Support Logger App is an Android-based tool that allows IT support personnel to log and track issues quickly and locally on their devices. This project demonstrates how to build a functional, user-friendly app using Java, SQLite, and Android Studio.

# What I Learned from Building the IT Support Logger App

# Project Summary:
I built a complete Android app called IT Support Logger, designed to let technicians log technical issues, actions taken, and resolutions. Users can log in, record logs, view past entries, and navigate between screens. The app uses a local SQLite database and is designed for a smooth user experience.

# Key Skills and Concepts I Learned

# Android Studio Development
- Understanding project structure, Gradle files, XML layouts
- Using emulators to test the app

# User Authentication (Login Screen)
- Built a login form using `EditText` and `Button`
- Used `SQLiteOpenHelper` to store user credentials
- Saved login state using `SharedPreferences`

# Database Design and Integration
- Created user and log tables in SQLite
- Wrote methods to insert and retrieve logs per user
- Learned how database structure affects data flow

# UI/UX Enhancements
- Added welcoming prompts ("Welcome to IT Support Logger!")
- Aligned elements using gravity and layout spacing
- Centered content for better readability

# Bug Debugging & Crash Handling
- Fixed crashes from:
  - Missing layout files (e.g. `activity_log_list.xml`)
  - Not declaring activities in `AndroidManifest.xml`
  - Inconsistent view IDs
- Used Logcat to identify and test issues

# Dynamic UI with RecyclerView
- Displayed logs in a scrollable list with custom adapter
- Created a custom XML (`item_log.xml`) for each log item
- Used data classes (`LogEntry`) and adapters to pass data

# Navigation & User Flow
- Realized "just functionality" isn't enough
- Added a View Logs button for history access
- Added a Back button for intuitive screen navigation

# Version Control and GitHub
- Initialized a Git repo and learned commit workflow
- Connected to GitHub and fixed push errors
- Wrote a complete, professional `README.md` with screenshots

# How I Solved Key Errors

| Error                              | Cause                                     | Fix                                                            |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| App crashed when viewing logs      | Missing `LogListActivity` in Manifest     | Added `<activity android:name=".LogListActivity" />`          |
| Login didn’t persist               | Forgot to store `user_id`                 | Used `SharedPreferences` to save and retrieve it              |
| `R.layout` or `R.id` turned red    | Layout files or IDs were missing/wrong    | Created missing XML files and matched correct IDs             |
| Couldn’t see RecyclerView content  | Adapter not set or layout missing         | Set LayoutManager and attached adapter correctly              |
| UI was stuck to the left           | Misused `textAlignment` vs `gravity`      | Switched to `android:gravity="center"`                        |
| Couldn’t go back from logs screen  | No navigation logic                       | Added a Back button and used `finish()`                       |

# Overall Reflection

Each time I completed a core step, I realized how to go further:

- After login worked, I needed to save the logs
- After saving logs, I wanted to view them
- After viewing logs, I realized I needed navigation, a back button
- Then I wanted it to look welcoming and professional

Through this project, I learned that building an app is not just writing code. It’s thinking like a user, debugging like a developer, and evolving like a designer.
